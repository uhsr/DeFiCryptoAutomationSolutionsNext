# DeFiCryptoAutomationSolutionsNext

## Description

A repository containing a Rust-based cryptographic library implementing lattice-based cryptography primitives optimized for post-quantum security, utilizing AVX2 intrinsics for accelerated polynomial arithmetic.

## Features

- Automates yield farming strategies using customizable risk parameters and smart contract logic.
- Integrates with decentralized exchanges (DEXs) via their APIs to execute automated token swaps.
- Implements a backtesting engine to simulate DeFi strategies against historical market data.
- Deploys automated liquidation bots that monitor collateralization ratios and trigger liquidations.
- Secures private keys using hardware security modules (HSMs) for enhanced security of automated transactions.
- Tracks portfolio performance across multiple DeFi protocols with real-time data visualization.
- Generates automated reports on DeFi positions, transaction history, and profit/loss statements.
- Employs an anomaly detection system that alerts users to unusual on-chain activity affecting their DeFi positions.
